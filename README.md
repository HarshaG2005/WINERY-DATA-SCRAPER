## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Firefox browser installed
- Internet connection

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-world-scraper.git
   cd wine-world-scraper
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the scraper:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üìã Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` file with these dependencies:

```txt
selenium>=4.15.0
webdriver-manager>=4.0.0
requests>=2.31.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0
```

## üîß Configuration

Key settings in `config.py`:

```python
# Scraping limits
MAX_PAGES = 500                    # Maximum pages to scrape
PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT = 60            # Page load timeout in seconds

# Delays (anti-detection)
MIN_DELAY = 1                     # Minimum delay between requests
MAX_DELAY = 3                     # Maximum delay between requests

# Output files
CSV_OUTPUT_FILE = 'wine_products.csv'
LINKS_FILE = 'wine_links.txt'
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Scrape with default settings
python main.py

# Limit to 50 pages
python main.py --max-pages 50

# Run a quick connectivity test
python main.py --test
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Use requests method (faster but less reliable)
python main.py --method requests --max-pages 100

# Resume from a backup file
python main.py --resume links_backup_page_25.txt
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from data_scraper import DataScraper
from link_scraper import LinkScraper

# Collect links
link_scraper = LinkScraper(max_pages_limit=10)
links = link_scraper.scrape_all_pages()

# Extract product data
data_scraper = DataScraper()
products = data_scraper.scrape_multiple_products(links)
```

## üìä Output Format

The scraper outputs data in CSV format with the following columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Title | Product name | "Ch√¢teau Margaux 2015" |
| Price | Product price | "Rs. 25,000.00" |
| Description | Short description | "Premium Bordeaux wine with rich flavor" |
| Origin | Country of origin | "France" |
| Weight | Product weight | "0.75 kg" |
| Size | Bottle size | "750ML" |
| Category | Wine category | "Red Wine" |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Core Components

1. **BaseScraper**: Foundation class with driver management and common functionality
2. **LinkScraper**: Handles pagination and link collection with popup management
3. **DataScraper**: Extracts detailed product information using multiple selector strategies
4. **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for data processing and file operations

### Key Features

- **Multi-Selector Strategy**: Uses multiple CSS/XPath selectors for resilient element finding
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatically categorizes wines based on title and description keywords
- **Size Detection**: Extracts bottle sizes from product titles
- **Error Page Detection**: Identifies and skips error pages automatically

### Anti-Detection Measures

- Random delays between requests
- User agent rotation
- Popup handling
- Respectful request patterns

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Firefox Driver Issues:**
```bash
# Update webdriver manager
pip install --upgrade webdriver-manager
```

**Timeout Errors:**
- Increase `PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT` in config.py
- Check internet connection stability

**No Products Found:**
- Website structure may have changed
- Update selectors in config.py
- Run with `--test` flag to diagnose

**Memory Issues:**
- Reduce `MAX_PAGES` limit
- Clear browser cache periodically

## üìà Performance

- **Speed**: ~5-10 seconds per page depending on content
- **Success Rate**: ~95% for accessible pages
- **Memory Usage**: ~100-200MB during operation
- **Output**: Processes 20-50 products per page typically
